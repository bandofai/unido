# Implementation Summary: CI/CD Setup

**Issue:** [#3 - CI/CD: Add GitHub Actions for Linting, Testing, and Build Validation](https://github.com/bandofai/unido/issues/3)

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Date:** 2025-10-17

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive CI/CD infrastructure using GitHub Actions to automate code quality checks, testing, and build validation. This ensures all contributions meet quality standards before merging.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Created comprehensive CI pipeline with the following jobs:

#### Lint Job
- Runs Biome linter on all code
- Command: `pnpm run lint`
- Validates code style and detects potential issues
- Timeout: 10 minutes

#### Format Check Job
- Verifies code formatting with Biome
- Command: `pnpm run format:check`
- Ensures consistent code formatting across the codebase
- Timeout: 10 minutes

#### Type Check Job
- Validates TypeScript types across all packages
- Command: `pnpm run type-check`
- Uses Turborepo to run `tsc --noEmit` in all packages
- Timeout: 10 minutes

#### Test Job
- Runs unit tests with Vitest
- Command: `pnpm run test`
- Validates package functionality
- Timeout: 10 minutes

#### Build Job
- Builds all packages using Turborepo
- Command: `pnpm run build`
- Uploads build artifacts (7-day retention)
- Validates that all packages compile successfully
- Timeout: 10 minutes

#### All Checks Passed Job
- Summary job that verifies all checks succeeded
- Fails if any check fails
- Useful for branch protection rules

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Concurrency control: Cancels in-progress runs for same branch/PR
- pnpm caching: Uses `actions/setup-node@v4` with `cache: 'pnpm'`
- Parallel execution: Jobs run in parallel where possible
- Frozen lockfile: `--frozen-lockfile` ensures reproducibility

### 2. Security Audit Workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

Created automated security monitoring:

#### Dependency Audit Job
- Runs `pnpm audit --audit-level moderate`
- Checks for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Continues on error (informational only)

#### License Check Job
- Lists all package licenses
- Generates `licenses.json` report
- Helps identify potential licensing issues

**Triggers:**
- Weekly schedule (Monday at 00:00 UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch
- Pushes to `main` that modify dependencies (`package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`)

### 3. Dependabot Configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)

Automated dependency updates:

**npm dependencies:**
- Weekly updates (Monday)
- Groups dependencies by type:
  - Development dependencies (minor + patch)
  - Production dependencies (minor + patch)
- Open PR limit: 10
- Labels: `dependencies`, `automated`
- Commit prefix: `chore`

**GitHub Actions:**
- Weekly updates (Monday)
- Keeps workflow actions up-to-date
- Labels: `dependencies`, `github-actions`, `automated`
- Commit prefix: `ci`

### 4. Documentation

#### CI/CD Documentation (`docs/contributing/CI_CD.md`)
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Overview of all workflows
- Job descriptions and commands
- Running checks locally
- PR requirements
- Troubleshooting guide
- Configuration files
- Future enhancements
- Best practices

#### Contributing Guide (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
Complete contributor documentation:

### 5. README Updates

Added CI status badge:
```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/bandofai/unido/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bandofai/unido/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
```

## Files Created

1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Main CI workflow (220 lines)
2. **`.github/workflows/security.yml`** - Security audit workflow (80 lines)
3. **`.github/dependabot.yml`** - Dependabot configuration (35 lines)
4. **`docs/contributing/CI_CD.md`** - CI/CD documentation (450+ lines)
5. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Contributing guide (350+ lines)
6. **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_ISSUE3.md`** - This file

## Files Modified

1. **`README.md`** - Added CI status badge

## CI Configuration Details

### Technology Stack
- **CI Platform:** GitHub Actions
- **Node.js Version:** 20 (LTS)
- **Package Manager:** pnpm 10
- **Linter/Formatter:** Biome 2.2.6
- **Build Tool:** Turborepo 2.3.3
- **Test Framework:** Vitest 2.1.8

### Workflow Actions Used
- `actions/checkout@v4` - Repository checkout
- `pnpm/action-setup@v4` - pnpm setup
- `actions/setup-node@v4` - Node.js setup with caching
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4` - Build artifact upload

### Job Timeouts
- All jobs: 10 minutes
- Prevents hanging jobs from consuming CI resources
- Reasonable for current codebase size

### Caching Strategy
- pnpm store cached via `actions/setup-node@v4`
- Cache key based on lockfile hash
- Significantly speeds up dependency installation
- Typical install time: 10-20 seconds (cached) vs 60+ seconds (uncached)

## PR Requirements

For a pull request to be merged, all CI checks must pass:

✅ **Required Checks:**
1. ✅ Lint (Biome)
2. ✅ Format Check (Biome)
3. ✅ Type Check (TypeScript)
4. ✅ Unit Tests (Vitest)
5. ✅ Build (Turborepo)

The "All Checks Passed" job can be used as a single required status check for branch protection.

## Running Checks Locally

Contributors can run the same checks locally before pushing:

```bash
# Individual checks
pnpm run lint           # Lint code
pnpm run format:check   # Check formatting
pnpm run type-check     # Type check
pnpm run test           # Run tests
pnpm run build          # Build packages

# Fix issues
pnpm run lint:fix       # Auto-fix linting
pnpm run format         # Auto-format code

# Run all checks (CI simulation)
pnpm run lint && \
pnpm run format:check && \
pnpm run type-check && \
pnpm run test && \
pnpm run build
```

## Security Features
